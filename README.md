This script is designed to bypass PHP-based whitelisting mechanisms. It exploits weaknesses in certain PHP configurations or implementations, allowing attackers to bypass restrictions and gain unauthorized access. It can be used as part of penetration testing or security auditing to test the robustness of web applications against whitelisting attempts.

# bypassing_php_whitelist_small.sh
This script is a smaller, optimized variant of the "bypassing-_php_whitelist_medium.sh" tool. It focuses on a specific set of vulnerabilities related to PHP whitelisting, designed for quicker testing or environments with tighter constraints. It helps to assess the security of PHP applications by targeting simpler or more easily exploitable whitelisting weaknesses.

# wordlistscreation.py
This Python script is designed to create extended wordlists by appending specified file extensions to each word in an existing wordlist. It's particularly useful for generating wordlists for brute-forcing or testing file upload mechanisms, backup files, or hidden file extensions in web applications. Users can specify a list of file extensions (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz, .bak, etc.) to append to each word in the input file, creating a customized wordlist for testing or security assessments.
