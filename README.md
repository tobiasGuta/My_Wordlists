This tool is a Bash script designed to facilitate the creation of wordlists tailored for upload attacks targeting web applications. It systematically generates a list of filenames incorporating various characters and common PHP file extensions. By iterating through different combinations of characters such as spaces, newlines, null bytes, carriage returns, slashes, dots, colons, and ellipses, and appending or prepending them to typical PHP file extensions, the script generates a comprehensive wordlist. Each generated filename represents a potential vector for upload-based attacks, helping security researchers and penetration testers assess and fortify the resilience of web applications against such threats.
